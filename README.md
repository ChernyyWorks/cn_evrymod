Hi !

This is a simple and silly script that recreate evry-mod on fivem.
The command is /brapbrapbrap, it enable the rpm control et turbo pressure of the car (called evrymod).
I suggest you to custom the car you're using and adding a custom exhaust (for pop and bang) and a turbo (for no lag).
Have fun !
